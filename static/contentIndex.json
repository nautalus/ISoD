He grew up in the capital city, but after completing The Service, settled in a much smaller outskirt city of the capital (or large town). Due to an innate aversion to causing direct harm, Klaus was trained as a medic during his service. Despite being nothing special at that work, people he tended to had a slightly greater than normal chance of not dying.\nPost-Service, Klaus worked in the clinic of the the city/town in which he resided. People who were not deemed worthwhile to use higher magical healing were directed to the clinic, and so he got to know many of the less fortunate folk of said local. Often, he would swipe surplus supplies and venture away from the city limits to visit and help those unwelcome in the city.\nAt some point in his late twenties, the dupe was up and Klaus was placed under arrest. While awaiting trial, by some miracle, a seismic event occurred which brought down most of the jail, except for where Klaus was sitting. He walked out, and on his way out of town was stopped by another guard. Some butterfly effect amount of luck caused some loosed barrels from several streets away to slam into the guard and knock him unconscious. Klaus turned to continue his “escape” when he tripped into a puddle. That, however is where his adventure began.\n\nat some point weeks past here there was an interaction with H. Ambroz, but prior to the next paragraph. H. Ambroz was unknowingly sent by Veylith to intercept Klaus.\n\nMany weeks pass as Klaus wanders the city streets of the middle realms, before Klaus is finally contacted “directly” by Veylith The Smiling Shadow and selected as a chosen few in his service as a cleric. It basically took a slap in the face for Klaus to realize this, as he was instead under the impression that true gods did not really exist.\nDuring the initial cleric years, Klaus was put to use and as a front served as a traveling healer. He was instead/also, a ferry of information and connections for Veylith and interested parties in the “background” movement small corruptions within the middle realms as well as the material planes. He got around, though rarely intentionally; often he would turn a corner, or walk past a threshold and find himself where he needed to be (whether he knew it or not).\nA couple of decades of life later, Klaus is a fully fledged cleric of Veylith, doing deeds to bring down the tyranny of the dragons.\nOne such adventure led him to be part of The Decimated Party, alongside Ooof, who were on the hunt for an artifact &amp; Goralek. A mere 4 out of 7 members survived the encounter: Ooof; Klaus; Thalen; Raviel Halcone\nAdditional BG tidbits:\n\nKlaus has small caches of basic supplies in many places of the realms and world. It quickly became standard practice to create a stash in a new place, especially if he thought it might join the revolving door of locations.\nWhile he doesn’t enjoy violence, he is not outright opposed to it. He will hurt people to protect people.\nHe especially hates bullies.\n\nTime as a PC\nAt the moment of the release of The Mother of Tides, Klaus joins task with Ooof, H. Ambroz, &amp; Odem in Zephryo’s Waypoint."},"PCs/Laika":{"slug":"PCs/Laika","filePath":"content/PCs/Laika.md","title":"Laika","links":[],"tags":["PC","NPC"],"content":""},"PCs/Meliana-Aubrin":{"slug":"PCs/Meliana-Aubrin","filePath":"content/PCs/Meliana Aubrin.md","title":"Meliana Aubrin","links":[],"tags":["PC","unalive"],"content":""},"PCs/Odem":{"slug":"PCs/Odem","filePath":"content/PCs/Odem.md","title":"Odem","links":["Locations/Lariden"],"tags":["PC"],"content":"from Lariden"},"PCs/Ooof":{"slug":"PCs/Ooof","filePath":"content/PCs/Ooof.md","title":"Ooof","links":["Locations/The-Barony-States"],"tags":["PC"],"content":"A Goliath Monk, Warrior of the Elements.\nGrew up on Material Plan, in the out-lands of The Barony States."},"PCs/Vem-Tidewater":{"slug":"PCs/Vem-Tidewater","filePath":"content/PCs/Vem Tidewater.md","title":"Vem Tidewater","links":["Locations/The-Empire","Events/The-Service","Items-and-Objects/The-Pride-of-Profit","NPC-Characters-and-Entities/Duke-Gordon","PCs/Flint","PCs/Buckminster","PCs/Meliana-Aubrin"],"tags":["PC","unalive"],"content":"Tim’s first character.
